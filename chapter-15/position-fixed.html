<!-- Fixed positioning uses position: fixed; 
 to keep an element in the same spot relative to the browser window, 
 even when scrolling. 
 
 The offset properties (top, bottom, left, right) control its position. 
 
 In this example, the heading is fixed to the top-left corner. 
 As the user scrolls, paragraphs move behind the heading. 
 Since <p> elements are in normal flow, 
 margin-top is used to push the first <p> below the fixed <h1>. -->
