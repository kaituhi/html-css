<!-- Block-level elements stack on top of each other by default. 
 This is the normal flow, which doesn't need a CSS property, 
 but you could use 'position: static;' to indicate it. 

 The heading element stretches the full width of the browser, 
 while the paragraphs are limited to 450px, 
 showing how elements start on a new line even if they don't fill the width.
