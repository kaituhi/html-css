<!-- The float property is often used to place boxes next to each other. 
 However, the height of floated elements can affect the positioning of following elements. 
 In this example, the fourth paragraph starts under the third because the second paragraph blocks it from moving further left. 
 Matching the height of all paragraphs could solve this, but it's not practical for varying content. 
 The 'clear' property is a better solution for this issue. -->
