<!-- To address the issue of containers collapsing when only containing floated elements, 
 developers traditionally added an extra element with `clear: both;` to force the container to expand. 
 
 Nowadays, a pure CSS solution is preferred, avoiding extra HTML elements. 
 This involves setting the container's `overflow` property to `auto` and its `width` to `100%`. -->
