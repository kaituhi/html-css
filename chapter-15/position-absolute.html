<!-- With position: absolute;, the element is removed from normal flow, so it doesn't affect other elements. 
 The offset properties (top, bottom, left, right) position it relative to its containing element. 
 In this example, the heading is placed at the top of the page and 500px from the left, with a width of 250px. 
 The <p> elements have a width set to avoid text overlap. 
 
 Browsers typically add a top margin to the <h1>, 
 creating a gap from the top of the browser. Use margin: 0px; to remove this gap. -->
