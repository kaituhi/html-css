<!-- Images are inline by default and flow with text. 
 To center an image, first set it to be a block-level element using `display: block`. 
 Then, you can center it using one of these methods:

1. Set `text-align: center` on the containing element.
2. Set `margin: auto` on the image.

Class names can be used to easily center images or any other elements, 
similar to how you handle dimensions and alignment. -->

      /><b><i>Magnolia</i></b> is a large genus that contains over 200 flowering
      plant species. It is named after French botanist Pierre Magnol and, having
      evolved before bees appeared, the flowers were developed to encourage
      pollination by beetle.
