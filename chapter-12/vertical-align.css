/* vertical-align is used to align inline elements (e.g., <img>, <em>) within their line box.
   It does not vertically align text in block elements (<p>, <div>).
   Values include:
   - baseline
   - sub
   - super
   - top
   - text-top
   - middle
   - bottom
   - text-bottom
   It can also take a length (px, em) or percentage of line height. 

   For example, if you have an image inside a line of text 
   and you want it to align with the text's baseline or sit slightly higher or lower relative to the text, 
   youâ€™d use this property. */
