<!-- margin: controls the space between boxes. 
    Values are usually in pixels but can be percentages or ems. 

    Margins collapse if one box is on top of another, using the larger margin.
    If a box width is specified, margin adds to its width.
    
    Specify margins individually with:
    - margin-top
    - margin-right
    - margin-bottom
    - margin-left

    Use shorthand to set all margins at once:
    margin: top right bottom left; (clockwise order).

    Somethimes you might see the following: 
        margin: 10px 20px; sets left/right to 10px and top/bottom to 20px.

    Margins are not inherited; set individually for each element. -->
