<!-- padding: sets the space between an element's content and its border.
    Values are usually in pixels, but percentages or ems can also be used.
    Padding is added to the width of the box.
    Specify padding for each side individually with:
    - padding-top
    - padding-right
    - padding-bottom
    - padding-left
    Use shorthand to set all four paddings in one line:
    padding: top right bottom left; (clockwise order).
    Padding is not inherited by child elements; it must be set individually. -->
