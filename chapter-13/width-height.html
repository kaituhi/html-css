<!-- By default, a box is sized to fit its content. 
   To set custom dimensions, use the 'height' and 'width' properties.
   Sizes can be set using:
   - Pixels: precise control over the box's size.
   - Percentages: relative to the parent container's size or the browser window.
   - Ems: relative to the text size within the box.

   Designers often use percentages and ems for flexible designs across different devices.

   Example: A <div> with a size of 300px by 300px contains a paragraph set to 75% width and height, 
   making it 225px by 225px.-->
