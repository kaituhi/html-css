<!-- To center a box horizontally on the page or within another element:
     1. Set a fixed width for the box (e.g., width: 300px;).
     2. Set the left and right margins to auto (e.g., margin: 0 auto;).
     
     This method ensures the box is centered with equal space on both sides. 
     Note: If the box has text and you donâ€™t want the text to be centered, 
     set text-align to left or another value on the box.
