<!-- 
The <link> element in HTML is used within the <head> to link a CSS file for styling the page. 
It is an empty element, so it doesn't require a closing tag. It typically uses three attributes:

- href: Specifies the path to the CSS file.
- type: Indicates the type of document, usually "text/css".
- rel: Defines the relationship, set to "stylesheet" for CSS files.

Multiple CSS files can be linked by using multiple <link> elements. 
For instance, one file may handle fonts and colors, while another controls layout.

    <title>Using External CSS</title>
    <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />

  <body>
    <h1>Potatoes</h1>
    <p>
      There are dozens of different potato varieties. They are usually described
      as early, second early and maincrop.

<!-- 
Why Use External Style Sheets?

- Consistency: All pages share the same CSS file, reducing code repetition.
- Performance: Faster page load times as the CSS is cached.
- Maintenance: Edit one file to update styles across the site.
- Clean HTML: Keeps HTML simpler and more readable.

Inline CSS Considerations

- Single Page: Useful for one-page sites or unique styles on individual pages.

Note: Examples in this book use <style> in the <head> for simplicity, 
but external CSS files are preferred.
