<!-- The <span> element is an inline version of <div>. It is typically used to: 
 1. Wrap a section of text when no other element fits. 
 2. Group inline elements together.

 The main reason for using <span> is to control its content's appearance with CSS. 
 Usually, a 'class' or 'id' attribute is added to a <span> to explain its purpose and apply specific CSS styles -->
