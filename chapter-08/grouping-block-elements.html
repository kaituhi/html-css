<!-- The <div> element groups multiple elements into one block-level box. 
 For instance, you can use <div> to contain your site's header or visitor comments. 
 By default, the content within a <div> starts on a new line, but it doesn't affect the page's appearance. 
 Adding an 'id' or 'class' to the <div> allows you to style it with CSS, 
 controlling its size and the look of the elements inside. 
 Using <div> also helps organize your code by clearly separating sections of the page -->


<div id="header">
  <img src="images/logo.gif" alt="Anish Kapoor" />
  <ul>
    <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="biography.html">Biography</a></li>
    <li><a href="works.html">Works</a></li>
    <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<!-- end of header -->
